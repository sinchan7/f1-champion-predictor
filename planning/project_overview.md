# 🧠 Project Overview – F1 Champion Predictor

## 🏎 Objective
Predict the Formula 1 World Drivers’ Champion (WDC) and Constructors’ Champion using data from the past 10 seasons (2014–2023).

The project will involve:
- Collecting F1 race, driver, and constructor data from public APIs.
- Engineering advanced features from race results, qualifying, and season summaries.
- Training machine learning models to classify the likely champions.
- Visualizing trends and predictions using Streamlit.

## 🏁 Outputs
- Predicted WDC and Constructors’ Champion for upcoming seasons
- Driver and constructor performance dashboards
- Interactive visualization of trends and stats
- GitHub repo + Deployed web app

## 🎯 Targets
- `is_driver_champion` → 1 if a driver wins the WDC that season
- `is_constructor_champion` → 1 if team wins Constructors' title
- Optional regression: `season_points`, `podium_count`
